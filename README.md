# Localendar

### What is Localendar?

Localendar is a centralized event board that enables easy gathering and supports tightly knit communities. Whether you are looking to host a public event or you are seeking out things to do nearby, Localendar can help. On the app, you can browse through events going on in any location, sorted by date or distance, and choose what you’d like to attend. Hosting events is easy too. Simply go to our “Create event” page, enter information like the name, date, and description, and post it. 

Information about the development process can be found in [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AxBoPRBYC-lHEhbhdok8yaEwzcHVF7MVAmAD_wT_Jj0/edit#slide=id.p).
